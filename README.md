# EatABurger

This application uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM using the MVC design pattern.

This applicaton is one of my first full stack projects! It logs burgers entered by the user and then allows the user to devour the burgers by changing their status in the database. I used Bootstrap with Handlebars to design the HTML.

The Heroku deployed version of the application can be found here: https://immense-escarpment-94559.herokuapp.com/
