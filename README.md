# EatABurger

This application uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM using the MVC design pattern.

The application logs burgers that you'd like to make and then allows you to devour the burgers. I used Bootstrap with Handlebars to design the HTML.

The Heroku deployed version of the application can be found here: https://mighty-thicket-79769.herokuapp.com/
