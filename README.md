# EatABurger

This application uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM using the MVC design pattern.

This applicaton is one of my first full stack projects! The application saves a user's burger order and adds it to the front-end. The burger was programmed with a status that changes in the database when the user clicks "devour." I created the link between the front- and back-ends using Handlebars templates. The front-end design is built with Bootstrap, Javascript, CSS and HTML.

The Heroku deployed version of the application can be found here: https://immense-escarpment-94559.herokuapp.com/
